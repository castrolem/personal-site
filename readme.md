# Luis's Personal Site

Making this site with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and lots of beverages.
:coffee: :wine_glass: :beers:

## Description
I wanted to create a place where I can post a little bit about me, that was open source so if anyone wanted to help me create a new cool effect for it, improve the code I made or just learn how I like to work using my code could do that.

Also this site will function as the default URL in all my profile accounts. It will provide a way for potential clients to contact me and find more about my work. Finally it will be a window to demonstrate the skills I have learned.


## URL
http://www.luiscastro.co


## Running the site
This site is created using `Yeoman`, so it's based in node. If you want to run the site for making an improvement or fork this repo, to install the site

#### You need to run the following commands in order.

* Fork and `git clone` your fork.
* `gem install jekyll`
* `gem install sass` (Unless you already have Sass gem installed in your computer)

#### To run the server
You can run the server using `jekyll server` and it will open your default browser in `http://localhost:4000/`.
