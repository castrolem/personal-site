I have been known for doing lots of deep dives and research before I buy anything among my friends, so I decided to share those thoughts and ideas with everyone. I'd like to make this a monthly thing, only when I have something interesting to share. Some months you will hear nothing, and that is the point.

Here's the good stuff: things you might not know existed, and might be interested in. Here are a few that I'm loving and using right now, plus my conclusions after I inevitably obsessed over the details.

## A few links I loved

### House stuff that made projects easier
I finally stopped doing the "level + pencil + patience" routine and bought two tools that have saved me an unreasonable amount of time:

- Stanley TML40 pocket laser meter. [Amazon Spain link](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B08ZD6RMCG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
- Bosch Quigo cross-line laser level. [Amazon Spain link](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B00DRDM1Q8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)

### Fashion rabbit holes I actually finished
- [Barbour Classic Beaufort waxed jacket](https://www.barbour.com/row/classic-beaufort®-waxed-jacket-MWX0002OL71.html). Heavy, needs breaking in, built like a tank. Buy from a reputable source because fakes are everywhere. I have received lots of compliments while wearing it.
  Bonus: [Lutz Waxed Jacket](https://www.barbour.com/row/lutz-waxed-jacket-MWX0566OL51.html) if you want a sharper "pub and pint" vibe.
- I'm no longer recommending Levi's 501 to anyone. I've worn through too many pairs too quickly.
  Replacement obsession: [Norse Projects Mogens relaxed 5-pocket heavy twill](https://www.norseprojects.com/store/men/trousers/mogens-relaxed-5-pocket-heavy-twill-black). The black one still looks like day one years later.
  If you want the "best of the best" (and expensive): [Iron Heart 25oz selvedge denim](https://ironheart.co.uk/collections/straight-cut/products/ih-634-xhs).

### Two fragrances that feel warm in winter
- [Loewe Esencia Eau de Parfum](https://www.loewe.com/eur/en/men/fragrances/loewe-esencia-eau-de-parfum-50ml/P000011X41-0000.html)
- [Replica Jazz Club by Maison Margiela](https://www.maisonmargiela.com/wx/replica-jazz-club-eau-de-toilette-S33YX0016S10930001.html)

Try them in-store if you can. Both have gotten me comments from other people about giving them a "cozy" feeling, which is exactly what we all want this time of year.

### Books
- Sci-fi: [Project Hail Mary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary) by Andy Weir. I read it on a round trip flight between Barcelona and Los Angeles, and I usually read sci-fi slowly. There's a film adaptation scheduled for March 20, 2026, and I'm curious how they'll translate some of the story to the screen, the book did some literally gymnastics to do some plot twists hah.
- Non-fiction: [Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens). If we've talked in the last five years, you've probably heard me mention it. I've listened to the audiobook three times and read it once. It keeps paying off.

### TV
A friend recommended *Attack on Titan*. I'd heard of it for years, but I never really got into anime. I was wrong. I enjoyed it a lot. The number of unexpected plot twists 🤯. I would have never expected it to the end the way it did.

Also, [The Expanse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854). The trailer makes it look like "just another sci-fi show", but it's probably the most complex and complete political series I've seen. Earth, Mars, and the Belt politics are so well done that I can't stop recommending it to anyone who hasn't watched it yet.

### Computer nerd corner
In 2024 I built a home server to download all my ~~TV shows and movies~~ [Linux ISOs](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Linux+ISO), using a NAS (Network Attached Storage).

Hardware: Terra Master [F424-Max](https://www.terra-master.com/products/f4-424-max) + 3×18TB enterprise Toshiba drives + 2×1TB NAS-grade SSDs.

Yes, it is overkill. This year I've been enjoying being a private "Netflix-like" provider to friends and family, plus using it for backups, ad-blocking, and other home network projects. If you're curious about the hobby, this is a good starting point: [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOaLlOAIWUU). Be warned, it's a vicious hobby.
